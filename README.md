# testlink v1.9.20 / apache 2.4.59

## Changes in the testlink folder
- changes are still needed within the container. the `config_db.inc.php` file that has the database creds doesn't exist and it has to be made manually in the testlink folder since testlink itself fails to make it and write into it. will may make it done with a command in the dockerfile in the next repo commit.
### The config_db.inc.php file content
```
<?php
// Automatically generated by TestLink installer (except the "?>" line) but fails to write it.
// values are ,of course, to be changed.
define('DB_TYPE', 'mysql');
define('DB_USER', 'testlink');
define('DB_PASS', 'testlink');
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
define('DB_NAME', 'testlink');
define('DB_TABLE_PREFIX', '');
?>
```

## Modification perhaps needed on the database
- You may need to make the testlink user yourself and grant him privileges yourself and then do the installation

- You may also need to change the variable sql-mode , remove `NO_ZERO_IN_DATE` and `NO_ZERO_DATE`, for the mysql database in case you get the error message `invalid default value for end_exec_ts`.
## The a2start.sh script
- The `a2start.sh` script serves as an entrypoint for the container. I made it in case of you have to modify the apache server within or make any changes that make you override the container's entrypoint. You can `docker commit` then run a new container from the resulting image with that script as an entrypoint to, kind of, revert the entrypoint to the original.
